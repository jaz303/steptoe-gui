Introduction

Introduce Steptoe
  - JS-like language
  - Benefits of JS semantics
  - Demonstrate env - add IO to it + functions are added to the stack

Repetition

Creativity
  - reduce likelihood of error
    - name mangling
    - auto formatting
    - scope highlighting
    - record / rewind
    - allow experimentation
    - generate code from examples


-----

Open questions:
  - snapshots (for rewind, demonstrate)
  - visualisation of stack/variables


UI - environment list
UI - create function
UI - edit function
UI - create image
UI - create sound?

 - language changes
   - idents get display name and internal name

 - all canvas drawing functions have access to VM context
 - whenever drawing operation takes place, associate with it current VM cycle, plus the
   node that was executing when it ran.
 
 - timeline view plots either:
   - condensed view
   - by cycle
   - by time

 - timeline:
   - row per channel:
     - canvas input
     - canvas output
     - console input
     - console output

 - editor
   - function
     - variables
     - inner functions
     - body
   - associate each node with real AST node (observe node)
   - rename operation
   - dim highlight accessible variables and accessible scopes


 - test in place
